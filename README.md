## Description

CineWizard is a single-page application that provides users with in-depth information about movies and TV shows, such as storyline, rating, cast, certificate, and genres. One essential feature allows users to search for titles by specific criteria, such as genre, release date, or director, making it easy for users to find content that matches their preferences. Users can also add movies and TV shows to their watchlist for future reference.
Overall, the key to developing a successful movie information website is to make it easy to use, informative, and engaging for users. It's important to consider the user's needs and preferences when designing the website, ensuring it is easy to navigate and search.

**Elevator Pitch**:
Donâ€™t know what to watch? Come to our website where you can browse a large collection of movies. Filter the most trending titles based on most watched movies, genres, release year, rating, cast and more. Keep track of your next watch using the provided watchlist feature.
