## 1. About cinewizard
        
     Project Description: Cinewizard is a single-page application that provides users with in depth information about movies and tv-shows, such as storyline, rating, cast, certificate, genres. One other feature, allows users to search for titles by specific criteria, such as genre, release date, or director. This makes it easy for users to find movies that match their preferences.
    Motivation: CineWizard aims to solve this problem by offering a comprehensive database of movies and TV shows, along with powerful filtering options.
    Users can easily discover new titles, create a watchlist, and access detailed information about each title, making their viewing experience more enjoyable.
